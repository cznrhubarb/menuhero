WAYS TO MAKE ACTION SELECTIONS INTERESTING
    Modifiers
        Target
        Elemental/type effectiveness
        Amount of mana to use (amplifier)
        AoE spread
        Duration
        Accuracy
        Power level (how long will you crank for power?)
            Maybe even a descending power as you crank for a big reward at the end
        Math or trivia (get it right to amplify stuff)

    Terminal actions
        Defense (vs just attacking)
        Buffs/Debuffs
        Combos (based on last action)
